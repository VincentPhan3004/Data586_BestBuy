# Project #1


# Project 2
Project #2 is on the CIFAR-10 dataset which includes 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The dataset is easily variable online and can be found in the Keras package. We want to create a CNN and see how the accuracy changes with changing the batch size and epochs. I also like working with image data and want to learn more about preparing images before using them in neural nets.
